	<h1>How to Make a Homemade Cup Speaker</h1>
	<p>
		In this project, we will be teaching you how to build a speaker inside a Solo&copy; Cup using household materials.
	</p>
	<br/>
		<div class="steps">
			<h2>What you will need:</h2>
			<ul class="speaker">
				<li>A Solo&copy; Cup</li>
				<li>Two smaller, paper cups</li>
				<li>Three Magnets (Preferably neodymium, the stronger the better)</li>
				<li>Copper wire (The smaller gauge, the better)</li>
				<li>Something to wrap the copper wire around (Slightly larger diameter than the magnets)</li>
				<li>A 3.5mm audio jack</li>
				<li>Soldering iron</li>
				<li>Tape</li>
				<li>Glue</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Step 1</h2>
			<h3>Making the Coil</h3>
			<p>
				First, take the object that you are going to wrap the coil around, and start wrapping the copper wire around it. Make sure the wire is wound as tightly as possible. This will make for a better speaker in the end.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<blockquote>
				Note: It is recommended that you tape down the first strand of copper wire, so that it does not move while you are wrapping the coil.
			</blockquote>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Stop wrapping the wire when the coil's length is around two inches, as that provides a larger magnetic field for louder, clearer sound. Make sure the ends of the coil are long enough to connect to the audio jack, or you will have to add more later. Secure the coil by coating it in tape, and carefully remove it from the object.
			</p>
			<h2>Step 2</h2>
			<h3>Building the Base</h3>
			<p>
				Thread both ends of the wire through one of the smaller paper cups, and then thread it through the red Solo&copy; Cup. Place the paper cup inside of the Solo&copy; Cup, and secure everything in place using whatever glue you have.

			<br/>
			<h2>Step 3</h2>
			<h3>Adding the Magnets (Magnet Cup)</h3>
			<p>
				First, take the magnets, and stack two of them on top of each other. Prepare the second paper cup by cutting off the top half of it. Then place the stack of two magnets on the inside of the cup, sticking them to the magnet on the outside of the cup.

			<br/>
			<h2>Step 4</h2>
			<h3>Adding the Audio Jack</h3>
			<p>
				Take the 3.5mm audio jack, and soldier both ends of the coil to both of the connection points of the jack. Add heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to further secure the connections.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<h2>Step 5</h2>
			<h3>Finishing the Speaker</h3>
			<p>
				Place the magnet cup inside of the paper cup in the Solo&copy; Cup, and plug the audio jack into whatever device you want.

			<h2>Step 6</h2>
			<h3>Enjoy Your New Speaker!</h3>
			<p>
				Congratulations! You have made a speaker that can fit inside of a red Solo&copy; Cup.
