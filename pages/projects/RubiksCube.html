		<h1>How to Solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube</h1>
		<p>
			In this project, we will be teaching you one method that can be used to solve a 3x3 Rubik's Cube.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<div class="steps">
			<h2>What you will need:</h2>
			<ul class="rubix">
				<li>A Rubik's&copy; Cube</li>
				<li>Spare Time</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Step 1: Solving the White Side</h2>
			<h3>Solving the "White Daisy"</h3>
			<p>
				First off, position the cube so that the yellow side faces upward. The white pieces need to be arranged around the yellow center so that it makes a "daisy" pattern, as shown below.
			</p>

			<h3>Solving the White Cross</h3>
			<p>
				Next, the white pieces need to be matched up with the other color on it, and moved down to the white side.
			</p>

			<h3>Solving the White Corners</h3>
			<p>
				After that, position the cube so that the white side faces upward. The white corners need to be moved into place using any of the three methods pictured below.
			</p>
			<table class="picture">
				<tr>
					<td>

						<p>
							In this case, use the algorithm to the right:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
							In this case, use the algorithm to the right:<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
							In this case, use either of the previous algorithms to move the piece temporarily.

					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			<blockquote>
				Note: The corner pieces may not be exactly in one of these three positions. Sometimes they can wind up on the bottom of the cube, or they can wind up on the top, but not in the right spot.<br/>
				If that happens, use one of the following methods to move it to where it needs to be.
			</blockquote><br/>
			<ul class="rubix">
				<li>
					If the corner piece is on the bottom, rotate the bottom until the corner is directly below its intended location. Then do the sequence below 1X, 2X or 3X or UNTIL it is in the correct position.<br/>
					<img src="../../images/Rubik's Cube Steps/Bottom White Corner Algorithm.png" alt="Ri, Di, R, D"/>
				</li>
				<li>
					If the corner piece is on the top, do the sequence as shown below, then use one of the three methods listed above to get it into the right spot.<br/>
					<img src="../../images/Rubik's Cube Steps/Top White Corner Algorithm.png" alt="Ri, Di, R"/>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				If the cube looks like this, then congratulations! You have solved the white side.
			</p>

			<br/>
			<h2>Step 2: Solving the Middle Layer</h2>
			<h3>Getting Started</h3>
			<p>
				Make sure to position the cube so the yellow side is facing upwards.<br/><br/><br/>
				Line up a vertical row of one single color (As shown below) before using the following algorithms.
			</p>
			<ul class="rubix">
				<li>
					If you are moving the indicated piece to the indicated location on the right side of the cube, use this algorithm:<br/>
					<img src="../../images/Rubik's Cube Steps/Middle Layer Right Side.png" alt="Moving Square to the Right"/>
					<img src="../../images/Rubik's Cube Steps/Middle Right Side Algorithm.png" alt="U, R, Ui, Ri, Ui, Fi, U, F"/>
				</li>
				<li>
					If you are moving the indicated piece to the indicated location on the left side of the cube, use this algorithm:<br/>
					<img src="../../images/Rubik's Cube Steps/Middle Layer Left Side.png" alt="Moving Square to the Left"/>
					<img src="../../images/Rubik's Cube Steps/Middle Left Side Algorithm.png" alt="Ui, Li, U, L, U, F, Ui, Fi"/>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Continue this step until all edge pieces are in position.
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				Note: If one of the edge pieces is already in the middle row, but in the wrong position, then do either one of the algorithms and it will move to the top layer. Then you can use the appropriate algorithm to position it in the correct location of the middle layer.
			</blockquote>
			<br/><br/>
			<p>
				If the cube looks like this, then congratulations! You have solved the middle layer.

						If no corner Cubes are yellow on the top face, you must have yellow left corner or left face as shown. Do the sequence below.

						If one corner Cube is yellow, match your top face as shown and do the sequence below.
						<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
						If any two corner Cubes are yellow don’t worry about their position. You MUST match the front face with a yellow left corner as shown. Do the sequence below 1, 2 or 3 times to achieve a complete yellow top face. After each sequence, orient the Rubik’s Cube to REMATCH the top face to the appropriate state and repeat the sequence until all the corners are yellow.
