		<h1>How to Hunt for Shiny Pok&#233;mon</h1>
		<p style="text-align:center">
			In this project, we will be teaching you 2 methods to efficiently find shiny pok&#233;mon in Pok&#233;mon Sun and Pok&#233;mon Moon.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<div class="steps">
			<h2>What you will need:</h2>
			<h3>Method 1:</h3>
			<ul class="pokemon">
				<li>Pok&#233;balls</li>
				<li>A Pok&#233;mon with the move False Swipe</li>
				<li>Adrenaline Orbs</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Method 2:</h3>
			<ul class="pokemon">
				<li>A Ditto (Preferably from a different region)</li>
				<li>The pokemon you want a shiny of</li>
				<li>A pokemon with the ability Flame Body</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Method 1</h2>
			<p>
				This method uses a mechanic call SOS chaining. SOS chaining is done by hurting a wild pokemon down to half health or less. Then the pokemon will call a pokemon. This new pokemon has a chance to shiny.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 1</h3>
			<p>
				First, you want to know where the pokemon you want to capture is located in the wild. For example, the pokemon Yungoos is found on route 1.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 2</h3>
			<p>
				When you know the location of the pokemon, go find it in the wild. Make sure the pokemon in your party that knows False Swipe is in the front of your party.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 3</h3>
			<p>
				After you encounter the pokemon in the wild, have your pokemon use False Swipe to knock the pokemon down to 1HP.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 4</h3>
			<p>
				Now you want to use the adrenaline orb to make the wild pokemon SOS call more often.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 5</h3>
			<p>
				Most likey, the pokemon that appears will not be shiny due to the low chance of actually finding one. But if the pokemon happens to be shiny, you want to knock out the pokemon with 1HP. You are not able to capture a pokemon if there are already 2 on the field. Throw the pokeball and capture your shiny pokemon!
			</p>
			<h3>Tips</h3>
			<p>
				The wild pokemon won't always call for help after you knock out the helping pokemon, or a pokemon doesn't always appear. So a good way to waist a turn is to go into your bag and use an adrenaline orb. This will only waist a turn and won't actually use the orb. If it is getting late into the fight, you may want to knock out the original pokemon in case it loses all of its PP and knocks itself out. Make sure when you knock it out, there is a SOS pokemon.
			</p>
			<h2>Method 2</h2>
			<p>
				With this method you will be breeding two pokemon from the same egg groups. We reccommend using a Ditto from a different region because of the Masuda method. The Masuda method is when your breed 2 pokemon from different regions. For example, by putting a Ditto from Germany and a Pikachu from France into the daycare, you double your chances of getting a shiny pokemon from hatching an egg. Ditto can breed with any pokemon that is able to breed.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 1</h3>
			<p>
				Deposit the Ditto and the wanted pokemon into the daycare.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 2</h3>
			<p>
				Go outside of the daycare, and straight south there is a fence opening. Stand in the middle and call your Tauros. Run around in a circle, for Tauros cannot leave the fence and you can just run inside the fence forever.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 3</h3>
			<p>
				Wait for the lady in front of the daycare to cross her arms and look down. This will indicate when she will have an egg for you. Say yes to her and she will give you an egg of the pokemon you put in the daycare with Ditto.
			</p>
			<h3>Step 4</h3>
			<p>
				Each pokemon has a certain number of steps to hatch them. This amount of steps can be reduced by half if you have a pokemon with the ablility Flame Body in your party. So all you have to do now is run in the fence with Tauros and you should have your hatched pokemon in less than a minute!
			</p>
			<h2>Notes</h2>
			<p>
				Hunting for shiny pokemon takes a very long time and lots of patience. The normal chance of finding a shiny is 1/4096. Thats less than .03% chance to find even one shiny pokemon! But thanks to the Masuda method and the SOS battles, those chances double to 1/2048 or about .05%. Lastly, if you complete the Alolan dex, you can recieve an item called the Shiny Charm, which doubles your chances even further to 1/1024 or .1%.
